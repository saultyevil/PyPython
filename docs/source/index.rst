pyPython Documentation
======================

pyPython is a module designed to make using Python and plotting the output from
a model less of a chore. Originally, this module was fairly simple and
consisted of a small number of modules designed mostly for plotting and running
a grid of Python simulations.

However, pyPython has now grown into a complex module which not only includes
the original modules for plotting, it also now includes multiple basic physics
modules as well a host of utility tools and scripts.
