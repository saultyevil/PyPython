# PyPython
A Python package to make using Python a wee bit easier.

## Dependencies
Fortunately, there are no _weird_ dependencies for PyPython. The majority of the
packages used throughout come with the standard Python installation or are 
easily available through `pip` or `conda`.

## Installation
PyPython can be easily installed using pip. The easiest way to install is to use
the following command in the root directory,

```bash
$ pip install -e .
```

## Examples

Provided in the `examples` directory are example scripts created to show how one
might choose to use PyPython. The name of the scripts are hopefully 
self-explanatory in what they create.
