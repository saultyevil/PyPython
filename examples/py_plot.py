"""
The purpose of this script is to tie together a bunch of plotting scripts into
one script. This way, instead of running each plotting script, one only needs
to run this script. However, the plots will be created with a default set of
parameters to keep this script simple. If you want more flexible options,
use (or edit) the other plotting scripts to fit your needs appropriately.
