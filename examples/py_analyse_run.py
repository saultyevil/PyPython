"""
This script should be run on a model to analyse a bunch of different parameters
about it. Information will be output both to the screen and to a separate HTML
file, where more context will be given.

The script will output:

    - Generic information about the model
    - Important parameters
    - The detailed convergence of the model
    - The last error summary of the model (at the end of ionization)
    - The luminosity balance of the created and escaping photons
    - Where luminosity is lost within the simulation
